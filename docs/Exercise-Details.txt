Mongo Database reference:
-DB: domainData
-User: domainReader
-Password: reader
-Auth mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-1

3 collections, domainA, domainB, domainC, with the same schema:
   SubjectId field (String),
   Timepoint field (Double), 
   NumericValue field (Double)

## Instructions: ##

1. Server-side C# Web API application (.net core):
   A. Create a C# data type to represent the scehma of the domainA, domainB, domainC collections. Name it "DomainValue".
   B. Create a C# data type to represent a schema with the fields:
       Timepoint field (Double), 
       AverageValue field (Double)
       *The schema represents the Average of Numeric values per time point, so name the data type accordingly.

   C. Implement a data access layer to retrieve or query data from a given collection in the database. 
      The data access layer should generalize the read access to the 3 collections and provide a uniform read access implementation for all of them, 
      as if there were N amount of tables with the same schema.
   D. Create a business layer:
       -Consume and use the data access layer.
       -Create an implementation to retrieve a list of all domains (collection names).

       -Create an implementation to retrieve the documents of a domain by domain name (collection name). 
        *Use the data type of #A for the results.
        *Consider limiting the retrieved documents to a given range.
       
       -Create an implementation to calculate the average of the numeric values, grouped by timepoint, for a given domain name (collection name).
        *Use the data type of #B for the results.

   E. Create a Web API:
       -Consume the business layer
       -Create a method to retrieve a list all domains
       -Create a method to retrieve the documents of a domain by domain name
       -Create a method to retrieve the average of the numeric values grouped by timepoint, for a given domain name

2. Client angular application 
   A. Create an angular application.
   B. The front page of the application should display a list of domain names. 
       Send a request to a running instance of the web api application to retrieve the list of domains.
   C. When a domain name is clicked (a default choice can be set), the client application should navigate to a domain-specific page.
       -In the domain-specific page, display a header with the name of the domain
       -Display a table with the documents of the domain collection. Send a request to a running instance of the web api application to retrieve the documents of a domain.
        *Consider paging of the documents in the table
   D. Under the rendered table, display a list of average values per time point. Send a request to a running instance of the web api application to retrieve the average values.

   ## Extra (Optional):
   A. Integrate plotly.js into the application (https://plot.ly/javascript/). You may use an angular component if you find one online.
   B. Display a plotly line chart below the list of average values.
       Use the same values of the list of average values per time point, where the x-axis values are set by the Timepoint field, and the y-axis values are set by the AverageValue field.
